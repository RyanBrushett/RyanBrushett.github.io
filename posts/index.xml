      <description>Unless you&amp;rsquo;re interested in reading why I like fast film, you can skip to this section for how I actually develop it. That&amp;rsquo;s the part that covers what made me want to write this in the first place. I kept losing my notes so this will actually serve as a long-winded note-to-self.
If you want to skip to some pictures, see results.
 Historical context Around 2007, I got pretty into photography.</description>

      <description>Yeah I might actually use this to write about things.
(2022-02-03): I&amp;rsquo;ve got so many half-finished drafts that have just been sitting there, neatly tucked away in their own little branches. Maybe I was just never destined to write like this.</description>
