      <description>TL;DR: So far so good&amp;hellip; follow along on Github!
I&amp;rsquo;m probably getting ahead of myself by writing this but it seems like I might actually be sticking with Advent of Code this year. I&amp;rsquo;ve set myself up for success and maybe this will hold me accountable&amp;hellip;
On Learning Stuff I&amp;rsquo;ve never completed a full Advent of Code.
Around October of this year I decided that was probably because I was trying to do too much at once.</description>

      <title>How Does Film Work?</title>

      <description>I wrote a thing about Pushing Delta 3200 which very lightly skimmed over a lot of actually pretty interesting things. I gave a high-level overview of how I develop a specific black and white film (with a lot about why I do it that way) but I&amp;rsquo;d like to explore some of the technical stuff a bit more. It&amp;rsquo;s a good excuse for me to research these things.
Seems logical to talk about what film actually is and how it works.</description>

      <description>Unless you&amp;rsquo;re interested in reading why I like fast film, you can skip to this section for how I actually develop it. That&amp;rsquo;s the part that covers what made me want to write this in the first place. I kept losing my notes so this will actually serve as a long-winded note-to-self.
If you want to skip to some pictures, see results.
Historical context Around 2007, I got pretty into photography.</description>

      <description>Yeah I might actually use this to write about things.
(2022-02-03): I&amp;rsquo;ve got so many half-finished drafts that have just been sitting there, neatly tucked away in their own little branches. Maybe I was just never destined to write like this.</description>
