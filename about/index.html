          Hi

    </header>

    <p>I grew up and lived most of my life on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newfoundland_%28island%29"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the island of Newfoundland</a> which is easily the best place on the planet. The people, the land, the sea, the culture - it&rsquo;s such a special place to call home. I got my B.Sc. studying computer science at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_University_of_Newfoundland"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Memorial University</a> in St. John&rsquo;s. I wasn&rsquo;t <em>great</em> at school but I loved it and I worked hard.</p>
<p>In 2022, I started working at a company called <a href="https://fullscript.com/careers"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fullscript</a>, hacking on Developer tools. I love it when the work that I do helps other people do their best work!</p>
<p>I have a lot of hobbies but I spend most of my time riding or tinkering with my bike. I really like wine, animals, cameras, guitars, and loud music. I have two cats and they hate each other but I love them and they love me so it&rsquo;s ok.</p>
<p>I made a little post about <a href="/posts/values" >things that are important to me</a> that you can read for a bit more detail.</p>
<p>I also made a <a href="/posts/readme" >README</a> if you&rsquo;re interested in reading about how I like to work.</p>

<ul>
<li>In 2016, I moved to Ontario to work for <a href="https://shopify.engineering/"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shopify</a>. I spent a lot of years making it easy for developers to understand and manage the infrastructure used by their applications in production. In January 2021 I started working with a team that focuses on gradual typing of Ruby at scale and later that year I took over managing that team! We broadened our focus to include IDE tools for Ruby developers. I&rsquo;m really proud of the work we did together! I left in 2022 after just over six years.</li>
<li>When I graduated in 2014, I worked at a little startup (it&rsquo;s no longer a startup) in St. John&rsquo;s called <a href="https://verafin.com/"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Verafin</a> where I did operations stuff with AWS. I learned a lot about automating infrastructure, scalability, etc.</li>
<li>I did an internship at <a href="https://www.ibm.com/ca-en/products/cognos-analytics"  class="external-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cognos</a> that became a nearly two year thing. I learned a lot about system administration, unix, operations, etc.</li>
<li>I spent some time as a sysadmin in the computer science department at my university and that&rsquo;s where I found out I loved working with Linux.</li>
