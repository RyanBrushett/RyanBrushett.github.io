      <h1>Hi</h1>
    </header>

    <p>I grew up and lived most of my life on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newfoundland_(island)">the island of Newfoundland</a>
which is easily the best place on the planet. The people, the land, the sea, the culture - it&rsquo;s such a special place
to call home. I got my B.Sc. studying computer science at
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_University_of_Newfoundland">Memorial University</a> in St. John&rsquo;s. I wasn&rsquo;t
<em>great</em> at school but I loved it and worked hard.</p>
<p>In 2016 I moved to Ontario to work for <a href="https://shopify.engineering/">Shopify</a> where I&rsquo;m now an engineering manager
so that worked out pretty well. It&rsquo;s a great environment to learn and grow. I spent a lot of years making it
easy for developers to understand and manage the infrastructure their apps are using. In January 2021 I started working
with a team that focuses on gradual typing of Ruby at scale and later that year I took over managing that team. We&rsquo;ve
broadened our scope to more generally include developer tools for Rubyists and I&rsquo;m excited about what we have planned!
A lot of the work that I do now is open-source which makes me really happy. I love it when the work that I do helps
other people do their best work.</p>
<p>I have a lot of hobbies but I spend most of my time taking photos and playing guitar. I really like wine, animals, and
loud music. I have two cats and they hate each other but I love them and they love me so it&rsquo;s ok.</p>
<h5 id="previous-work-stuff">Previous work stuff</h5>
<ul>
<li>I spent some time as a sysadmin in the computer science department at my university and that&rsquo;s where I found out I
loved working with Linux.</li>
<li>I did an internship at <a href="https://www.ibm.com/ca-en/products/cognos-analytics">Cognos</a> that became a nearly two year
thing. I learned a lot about system administration, unix, operations, etc.</li>
<li>After I graduated in 2014, I worked at a little startup (it&rsquo;s no longer a startup) in St. John&rsquo;s called
<a href="https://verafin.com/">Verafin</a> where I did operations stuff with AWS. I learned a lot about automating infrastructure,
scalability, etc.</li>
</ul>
