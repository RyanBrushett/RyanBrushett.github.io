      <description>I grew up and lived most of my life on the island of Newfoundland which is easily the best place on the planet. The people, the land, the sea, the culture - it&amp;rsquo;s such a special place to call home. I got my B.Sc. studying computer science at Memorial University in St. John&amp;rsquo;s. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t great at school but I loved it and worked hard.
In 2016 I moved to Ontario to work for Shopify where I&amp;rsquo;m now an engineering manager so that worked out pretty well.</description>
