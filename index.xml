      <title>How Does Film Work?</title>

      <description>I wrote a thing about Pushing Delta 3200 which very lightly skimmed over a lot of actually pretty interesting things. I gave a high-level overview of how I develop a specific black and white film (with a lot about why I do it that way) but I&amp;rsquo;d like to explore some of the technical stuff a bit more. It&amp;rsquo;s a good excuse for me to research these things.
Seems logical to talk about what film actually is and how it works.</description>

      <description>Unless you&amp;rsquo;re interested in reading why I like fast film, you can skip to this section for how I actually develop it. That&amp;rsquo;s the part that covers what made me want to write this in the first place. I kept losing my notes so this will actually serve as a long-winded note-to-self.
If you want to skip to some pictures, see results.
Historical context Around 2007, I got pretty into photography.</description>

      <description>I grew up and lived most of my life on the island of Newfoundland which is easily the best place on the planet. The people, the land, the sea, the culture - it&amp;rsquo;s such a special place to call home. I got my B.Sc. studying computer science at Memorial University in St. John&amp;rsquo;s. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t great at school but I loved it and worked hard.
In 2022, I started working at a company called Fullscript, hacking on Developer tools.</description>

      <description>Yeah I might actually use this to write about things.
(2022-02-03): I&amp;rsquo;ve got so many half-finished drafts that have just been sitting there, neatly tucked away in their own little branches. Maybe I was just never destined to write like this.</description>
