      <description>TL;DR: I probably won&amp;rsquo;t stick with advent of code again but I&amp;rsquo;m going to try!
I once eagerly declared my intention to finish Advent of Code and then didn&amp;rsquo;t. I&amp;rsquo;m going to be a bit more realistic about my expectations this year.
This is what I said in my follow-up on accountability&amp;hellip;
Next year I hope to do better, get farther, be faster, etc. I&amp;rsquo;ll use Ruby again! And it&amp;rsquo;ll be a lot of fun again!</description>

      <description>TL;DR: I never stuck with Advent of Code and I think that&amp;rsquo;s mostly OK.
As a follow up to my eager and excited post about Advent of Code&amp;hellip; I was definitely getting ahead of myself haha. I&amp;rsquo;ve still never completed a full advent of code.
On learning stuff I said the thing I&amp;rsquo;d set out to learn is &amp;ldquo;finishing Advent of Code&amp;rdquo; but I actually learned a lot, even using a language I&amp;rsquo;m pretty handy with.</description>

      <description>TL;DR: So far so good&amp;hellip; follow along on Github!
I&amp;rsquo;m probably getting ahead of myself by writing this but it seems like I might actually be sticking with Advent of Code this year. I&amp;rsquo;ve set myself up for success and maybe this will hold me accountable&amp;hellip;
On Learning Stuff I&amp;rsquo;ve never completed a full Advent of Code.
Around October of this year I decided that was probably because I was trying to do too much at once.</description>
