      <description>I wrote a thing about Pushing Delta 3200 which very lightly skimmed over a lot of actually pretty interesting things. I gave a high-level overview of how I develop a specific black and white film (with a lot about why I do it that way) but I&amp;rsquo;d like to explore some of the technical stuff a bit more. It&amp;rsquo;s a good excuse for me to research these things.&#xA;Seems logical to talk about what film actually is and how it works.</description>

      <description>Unless you&amp;rsquo;re interested in reading why I like fast film, you can skip to this section for how I actually develop it. That&amp;rsquo;s the part that covers what made me want to write this in the first place. I kept losing my notes so this will actually serve as a long-winded note-to-self.&#xA;If you want to skip to some pictures, see results.&#xA;Historical context Around 2007, I got pretty into photography.</description>
